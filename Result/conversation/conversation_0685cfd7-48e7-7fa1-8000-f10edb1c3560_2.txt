You are an advanced QA automation agent.
Your job is to execute and validate ALL scenarios described in the following Gherkin feature file, including scenario outlines with examples.
For each scenario:
- Attempt to perform all steps as described.
- For scenario outlines, iterate through all example rows.
- After each scenario, record whether it passed or failed, and provide a short summary.
- If a step cannot be performed, explain why and mark the scenario as failed.

Here is the feature file:

Feature: Simplified Checkout Instance Management
  As a registered user
  I want to create a new instance in Simplified Checkout
  So that I can manage my checkout configurations

  Background:
    Given the user has valid credentials
    And the Simplified Checkout application is available

  @smoke @login @instance-creation
  Scenario: Successfully create a new instance in Simplified Checkout
    Given I navigate to "https://checkout.simplified.ai/"
    When I enter x_Email in the email field
    And I enter x_Password in the password field
    And I check the "Remember me" checkbox
    And I click the "Sign in" button
    Then I should be successfully logged into the dashboard
    And I should see the main application interface

    When I search for the "My APP" section
    And I locate the "Simplified Checkout" application
    And I click on the "Simplified Checkout" app
    Then I should be redirected to the Simplified Checkout interface
    And the application should load completely

    When I click on the "Instances" menu item in the left navigation
    And I wait for the instances page to load completely
    And I click on the "Create Instance" button
    Then I should see the instance creation form
    And all required fields should be visible
    And the form should be ready for input

  @negative @login
  Scenario: Login failure with invalid credentials
    Given I navigate to "https://checkout.simplified.ai/"
    When I enter "invalid@email.com" in the email field
    And I enter "wrongpassword" in the password field
    And I click the "Sign in" button
    Then I should see an error message
    And I should remain on the login page

  @edge-case @navigation
  Scenario: Handle case when Simplified Checkout app is not found
    Given I navigate to "https://checkout.simplified.ai/"
    And I login with valid credentials
    When I search for the "My APP" section
    But the "Simplified Checkout" application is not visible
    Then I should see a message indicating no apps are available
    Or I should see an option to install the application

  @accessibility @ui
  Scenario: Verify accessibility and UI elements
    Given I navigate to "https://checkout.simplified.ai/"
    When I examine the login page
    Then all form fields should have proper labels
    And the "Sign in" button should be accessible via keyboard
    And the "Remember me" checkbox should be properly labeled
    And the page should have appropriate ARIA attributes

  # Data-driven test scenarios
  @data-driven
  Scenario Outline: Test login with different credential combinations
    Given I navigate to "https://checkout.simplified.ai/"
    When I enter "<email>" in the email field
    And I enter "<password>" in the password field
    And I click the "Sign in" button
    Then I should see "<expected_result>"



  @performance @load-time
  Scenario: Verify page load performance
    Given I navigate to "https://checkout.simplified.ai/"
    When I login with valid credentials
    And I navigate to the "Simplified Checkout" app
    And I click on the "Instances" menu
    Then the page should load within 5 seconds
    And all interactive elements should be responsive

  @security @session
  Scenario: Verify remember me functionality
    Given I navigate to "https://checkout.simplified.ai/"
    When I login with valid credentials
    And I check the "Remember me" checkbox
    And I close the browser
    And I reopen the browser
    And I navigate to "https://checkout.simplified.ai/"
    Then I should remain logged in
    And I should see the dashboard without re-entering credentials

  @cleanup
  Scenario: Test cleanup and logout
    Given I am logged into the Simplified Checkout application
    When I complete my instance creation tasks
    Then I should be able to logout successfully
    And my session should be properly terminated
